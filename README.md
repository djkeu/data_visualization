## 15.1 Cubes
        A number raised to the third power is a cube. Plot the first five cubic numbers, and then plot the first 5000 cubic numbers.

## 15.2 Coloured cubes
        Apply a colormap to your cubes plot.

## 15.3 Molecular motion
        Modify rw_visual.py by replacing plt.scatter() with plt.plot(). To simulate the path of a pollen grain on the surface of a drop of water, pass in the rw.x_values and rw.y_values, and include a linewidth argument. Use 5000 instead of 50,000 points
            molecular_motion.py
    
## 15.4 Modified random walks
        In the RandomWalk class, x_step and y_step are generated from the same set of conditions. The direction is chosen randomly from the list [1, -1] and the distance from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Modify the values in these lists to see what happens to the overall shape of your walks. Try a longer list of choices for the distance, such as 0 through 8, or remove the âˆ’1 from the x or y direction list.
            molecular_walk.py
    
## 15.5 Refactoring
        The fill_walk() method is lengthy. Create a new method called get_step() to determine the direction and distance for each step, and then calculate the step. You should end up with two calls to get_step() in fill_walk():
        
        x_step = self.get_step()
        y_step = self.get_step()
        
        This refactoring should reduce the size of fill_walk() and make the method easier to read and understand.
